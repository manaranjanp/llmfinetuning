Commentary
"Nehra to Mandeep, FOUR, first boundary for Mandeep and RCB. Full and on the pads, needed to be put away and Mandeep did just that, picked it up and dispatched it over mid-wicket, couple of bounces and into the fence"
"Nehra to Mandeep, FOUR, back-to-back boundaries to end the first over. Again, Nehra is a tad short in his length, Mandeep had the width to cut and he didn't try to hit it hard, just placed it behind point and Bhuvi at third man gave up the chase pretty quickly"
"Henriques to Kedar Jadhav, FOUR, hit straight back at Henriques and he was late to get his hand up. Once more the off-cutter which almost fooled Jadhav, who shimmied down and checked his drive, middled it alright to beat the mid-off fielder"
"Nehra to Kedar Jadhav, FOUR, another full toss, it's Jadhav this time and he picks his spot into the deep mid-wicket fence. Not great bowling from Nehra. He's missing the yorker by quite a bit"
"Nehra to Kedar Jadhav, FOUR, four more. Jadhav starting to really find his timing now and he's looking dangerous. This is smart batting rather than just throwing his bat at everything. He knows that fine leg is up and so he waits for the back of a length delivery to come to him before pulling it over the fielder. Nehra under pressure"
"Henriques to Kedar Jadhav, out Kedar Jadhav Run Out!! 1 run completed. Cutting has conjured a wicket out of nowhere. That's a sensational throw from the deep. My goodness. He's absolutely nailed the stump from long leg and Jadhav is out of here. This is a huge moment in the context of the match, especially as Jadhav was looking so good. Even this shot which he played was extraordinary. It was a length ball outside off, Jadhav sat on his back knee and scooped it over short fine leg. He was a little slow to decide on the second run, maybe a little hesitant and boy did Cutting make him pay! More than a couple of feet short, even with a dive. Kedar Jadhav run out (Cutting) 31(16) [4s-4 6s-1]"
"Rashid Khan to Head, FOUR, goes down and smashes the full toss over the deep mid-wicket ropes. Some nerves maybe from the Afghanistan leggie and Head pounced all over them with a mighty slog-sweep"
"Rashid Khan to Head, out Caught by Yuvraj!! Rashid strikes back! That might have been the googly. Yeah, it seems so. Head went for another slog-sweep, but due to the variation, Rashid managed to generate some extra-bounce which took more of a thick top-edge and lobbed up towards long-on. It still came really close to clearing the boundary though. Yuvraj keeps his cool and takes it smartly. Head c Yuvraj b Rashid Khan 30(22) [4s-3]"
"Bipul Sharma to Sachin Baby, out Caught by Henriques!! Straight up off a leading edge, taken! SRH taking control. There's no turn on the ball as Bipul fires it on leg-stump from round the wicket, Baby swings across the line and is undone by the sliding delivery. Good catch from Henriques too. He pedalled backwards from mid-wicket and made it much easier than it should have been. Sachin Baby c Henriques b Bipul Sharma 1(3)"
"Rashid Khan to Watson, SIX, Rashid finishes with a long hop. To be fair, it's not abysmally short, but Watson is so good on the back foot. Rocks back quickly and hammers the pull over long-on"
"Cutting to Binny, SIX, slower ball again but this time Binny hacks it over deep mid-wicket. It was slightly closer to off-stump and was given a fair tonk"
"Cutting to Watson, FOUR, plants his foot down and absolutely drills the ball wide of a diving extra-cover. Overpitched from Cutting, Watson blasts him away"
"Bhuvneshwar to Binny, 1 run, dropped! Naman Ojha, with the gloves on, puts one down. The ball went high up and was swirling awkwardly all the way through. But at this level, it should be taken. Binny was completely duped by the slower leg-cutter. Such good bowling from Bhuvi to keep it wide of off and out of reach"
"Bhuvneshwar to Binny, out Caught by Yuvraj!! Gone this time. Yuvraj makes no mistake at backward point. What a top over this has been from Bhuvneshwar. It may now be a mountain too high for the RCB to climb. Binny backs away to slash a back of a length delivery over point. But this is a leg-cutter which bounces spongily and he slices it up to the fielder. Binny c Yuvraj b Bhuvneshwar 11(10) [6s-1]"
"Nehra to Watson, out Caught by Henriques!! That's the end of Watson, and of RCB. The little bit of reverse-swing which Nehra uses to curl the ball away from Watson does his undoing. Despite it being another full toss, Watson slices it straight up off the outside half of his bat. Simple catch at extra-cover. Watson c Henriques b Nehra 22(17) [4s-1
